# Mles WebWorker

Mles WebWorker is an open source Mles (Modern Lightweight channEl Service) protocol Layer 2 implementation written in JavaScript. It used as part of MlesTalk Android app, but it can be used independently by any application over its messaging application interface.

All messaging is secured by 56-bit Blowfish [1] with ciphertext stealing (CTS [2]) + All-or-nothing-transform (AONT [3]) and Blake2 [4] HMAC.

Please see http://mles.io/app for more details about MlesTalk.
